<h2 style="color: #000000;">You're Making Someone Else Rich.</h2>
<p>Working at a job sucks. You know what I'm talking about. You're trading hours of your life you'll never get back for a measly sum of money every week or two, and what do you have to show for it? Nothing, because all your hard work is owned by your company.</p>
<h3 style="color: #000000;">What's worse is that you're making someone else's dreams come true, making them rich or both.&nbsp;</h3>
<p>That's what I'm thinking about right now, staring at an empty excel file that I'm supposed to fill out with income reports. It's disheartening a little... Tabulating all the money that my company makes and then, how much goes to the CEO... Let me tell you. <strong>He's making over 10,000,000 a year</strong>, and that's just what he gets on a normal basis. When you add in his profit sharing, self assigned bonuses to the board and himself and all the other companies and entities he has stake in, he's gotta be making well over 40 million a year.</p>
<p>I've never dreamed to make that much. I wouldn't turn it down, but right now, I don't think that I could dream that big. At that point, you could pretty much buy anything you wanted. Sure, it's gotta be nice. Who wouldn't like to have the kind of options that money would give you?</p>
